# Write Once, Run Anywhere: Transcompiling Tensor Programs for Deep Learning Systems with a Neural-Symbolic Approach
<img src="docs/static/images/overview.png" style="zoom:50%;" /> 

The overview of QiMeng-Xpiler, a novel transcompiler for automatic transcompilation of tensor programs across different programming models. QiMeng-Xpiler consists of two parts: (a) neural-symbolic program synthesis, which utilizes LLM to transform code and repair incorrect transformation through symbolic synthesis with limited scales, and (b) hierarchical performance auto-tuning, which systemically explores both the parameters and sequences of transformation passes.
